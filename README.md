Detect whatever you want.

# Usage

# To use this model:

1.  Click the Open in Colab button below, or check out the main code in the Detect_Anything.ipynb file.
2.  If you're running the model on Colab, change your runtime setting to T4 GPU for faster processing.
3.  In line 7 or 8, upload the video you want to detect.
4.  In line 10, tell the model what you want to detect in the video, such as "man", "bottle", etc.
5.  For testing purposes, keep your input video short (up to 3 seconds).
